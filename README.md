# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from Scratch in Python

This project demonstrates a complete implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm from scratch using Python. It includes training, testing, evaluation using various metrics, and visualization of model performance for different values of **k**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Implemented KNN without using machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`.
- Tested the model using **two different values of k**.
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Classification Report
- Plotted **error rate vs k values** to observe performance trends.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

- `KNN_Implementation.ipynb` â€” Main Jupyter notebook with the full code and results.
- `Document.pdf` â€” Project documentation.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
